% <seeds> is is outputs of analyzePRFcomputesupergridseeds
% <stimulus> is a cell vector of time x (pixels+1)
% <data> is a cell vector of X x Y x Z x time (or XYZ x time)
% <modelfun> is a function that accepts parameters (pp) and stimuli (dd) and outputs predicted time-series (time x 1)
% <maxpolydeg> is a vector of degrees (one element for each run)
% <dimdata> is number of dimensions that pertain to voxels
% <dimtime> is the dimension that is the time dimension
% <noisereg> is [] or a set of noise regressors (cell vector of matrices)
